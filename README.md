> **"Bridging the gap between theory and practice in application security."**

ATLAS is a comprehensive security assessment framework designed for students, developers, and security enthusiasts. It combines automated reconnaissance, modular vulnerability checks, and interactive learning workflows into a unified, easy-to-use platform.

## Key Features

### Reconnaissance
*   **Automated Nmap Integration**: Effortlessly scan targets for open ports and services.
*   **Service Fingerprinting**: Identify running applications and versions.
*   **Tech Stack Detection**: Uncover backend technologies (e.g., PHP, Django, NodeJS).

### Vulnerability Assessment
*   **Modular Check Engine**: Run targeted checks for specific vulnerabilities.
*   **Supported Checks**:
    *   SQL Injection (SQLi)
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
    *   Directory Traversal / LFI
    *   Weak Credentials (Brute-force)
    *   Misconfiguration Detection

### Interactive Learning
*   **Guided Mode**: Step-by-step wizard for setting up scans and understanding each phase.
*   **Demo Targets**: Practice safely with one-click presets for **VulnBank** (Web) and **IoTGoat** (IoT).
*   **Real-time Terminal**: Integrated web-based terminal for manual verification and advanced commands.

### Reporting & Dashboard
*   **Modern Web UI**: Dark-themed dashboard built with HTML5/CSS3/JS.
*   **Detailed Reports**: Generate HTML and JSON reports with remediation advice.
*   **Scan History**: View past assessments and track progress.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
*   **Python 3.10+**
*   **Nmap** (must be installed and in your system PATH)
    *   Linux: `sudo apt install nmap`
    *   macOS: `brew install nmap`
    *   Windows: [Download Installer](https://nmap.org/download.html)

### Setup Steps
1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/atlas.git
    cd atlas
    ```

2.  **Create Virtual Environment** (Recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

### Quick Start (Web UI)
Launch the API server and access the dashboard:
```bash
python -m uvicorn api.main:app --reload --port 8000
```
Open **http://localhost:8000** in your browser.
*   **Login**: Default credentials (if applicable) or register a new account.
*   **Dashboard**: Manage scans, view reports, and access the terminal.

### Secure Web Terminal (Production Defaults)
The web terminal is **disabled by default** and only runs in restricted mode.

Environment variables:
```bash
ATLAS_ENABLE_WEB_TERMINAL=true
ATLAS_WEB_TERMINAL_MODE=safe
ATLAS_TERMINAL_COMMAND_TIMEOUT=10
ATLAS_TERMINAL_OUTPUT_LIMIT_CHARS=12000
ATLAS_TERMINAL_MAX_INPUT_CHARS=256
```

Restricted mode does **not** expose raw Bash. It allows only a fixed command set:
`help`, `clear`, `whoami`, `date`, `pwd`, `ls`, `cat`, `atlas checks`, `atlas scans`, `atlas health`, `exit`.

### Command Line Interface (CLI)
Automate tasks directly from your terminal:

**Start a Scan:**
```bash
python -m cli.main scan http://localhost:3000 --profile full
```

**Launch Demo Target:**
```bash
python -m cli.main demo vulnbank
```

**List Available Checks:**
```bash
python -m cli.main checks list
```
